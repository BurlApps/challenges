# Challenge

Engineers and designers love snacks. They love to eat yogurt 
covered pretzels, beef jerky, trail mix, and more. Your goal 
is to build a random snack dispenser that keeps track of snack 
supply levels and satiates hungry team members’ sizable appetites. 
Feel free to supply the machine with your favorite snacks.

Your solution should use HTML, Javascript and CSS. Feel free to use 
frameworks and plugins as you see fit. Please include the source code 
and a runnable version in your submission.

Your random snack dispenser should have a button to dispense a random 
snack and a display reel of snacks. When the button is pressed, the 
dispenser should arrive at a randomly selected snack. If the snack is 
in stock and the user wants it, the user can choose to dispense the snack 
and go about their day happily sustained with delicious nourishment. If the 
snack is out of stock or the user decides they don’t want it, the user should 
be able to cancel the request to reset the machine.

We’ll be looking for exceptionally clean code and thoughtful design, built with 
engineering maintainability and user experience in mind. Show off your UI/UX 
skills! The more creative your solution, the better.

You have 48 hours to submit your solution. You may choose to spend as little or 
as much time as you feel is appropriate.

Look forward to your submission!
